/*
Given an integer array hours representing times in hours, return an integer denoting the number of pairs i, j where i < j and hours[i] + hours[j] forms a complete day.

A complete day is defined as a time duration that is an exact multiple of 24 hours.

For example, 1 day is 24 hours, 2 days is 48 hours, 3 days is 72 hours, and so on.
*/


/*
Example 1:

Input: hours = [12,12,30,24,24]

Output: 2

Explanation:

The pairs of indices that form a complete day are (0, 1) and (3, 4).

Example 2:

Input: hours = [72,48,24,3]

Output: 3

Explanation:

The pairs of indices that form a complete day are (0, 1), (0, 2), and (1, 2).

/*
Constraints:

1 <= hours.length <= 100
1 <= hours[i] <= 109
