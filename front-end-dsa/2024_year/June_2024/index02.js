/*
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
*/


/*
Example 1:

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:

Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
*/


/*
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is a printable ascii character.
