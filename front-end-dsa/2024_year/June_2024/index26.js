/*
You are given a 2D binary array grid. Find a rectangle with horizontal and vertical sides with the smallest area, such that all the 1's in grid lie inside this rectangle.

Return the minimum possible area of the rectangle.
*/


/*
Example 1:

Input: grid = [[0,1,0],[1,0,1]]

Output: 6

Explanation:



The smallest rectangle has a height of 2 and a width of 3, so it has an area of 2 * 3 = 6.

Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,0],[0,0]]

Output: 1

Explanation:



The smallest rectangle has both height and width 1, so its area is 1 * 1 = 1.
*/


/*
Constraints:

1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 1000
grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
The input is generated such that there is at least one 1 in grid.
