/*
You are given two positive integers x and y, denoting the number of coins with values 75 and 10 respectively.

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Each turn, starting with Alice, the player must pick up coins with a total value 115. If the player is unable to do so, they lose the game.

Return the name of the player who wins the game if both players play optimally.
*/
