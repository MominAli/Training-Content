/*
You are given a string s and an integer k. Encrypt the string using the following algorithm:

For each character c in s, replace c with the kth character after c in the string (in a cyclic manner).
Return the encrypted string.
*/


/*
Example 1:

Input: s = "dart", k = 3

Output: "tdar"

Explanation:

For i = 0, the 3rd character after 'd' is 't'.
For i = 1, the 3rd character after 'a' is 'd'.
For i = 2, the 3rd character after 'r' is 'a'.
For i = 3, the 3rd character after 't' is 'r'.

Example 2:

Input: s = "aaa", k = 1

Output: "aaa"

Explanation:

As all the characters are the same, the encrypted string will also be the same.

/*
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
1 <= k <= 104
s consists only of lowercase English letters.
