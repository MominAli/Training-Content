After taking 200+ interviews in the past 5 years. Here are some tips to help you ace your technical interview-

1. Slow Down and Think:

Don't rush into coding! Repeat the question, ask clarifying questions, and validate all assumptions with examples.

2. Showcase Your Thought Process:

Walk through 1-2 sample inputs/outputs, including edge cases and use cases. Explain your logic clearly, demonstrating how you reach solutions.

3. Master the Big Picture:

Before diving into code, verbalize the high-level logical steps and data structures you plan to use. This shows your understanding of the problem and ability to plan effectively. Ô∏è

4. Think Beyond the Obvious:

Go beyond standard test cases and brainstorm potential boundary scenarios. This demonstrates your problem-solving skills and critical thinking.

5. Time Management Matters:

Understand the interview format and how many questions to expect. Allocate your time wisely and focus on delivering your best work.


Remember: The interview is a conversation, not a race. Take your time, carefully discuss each step, and utilize the full allotted time.

Don't stress about optimizations at the end; focus on demonstrating your knowledge and thought process throughout the interview.
