There is a 98% chance you will work with a REST API.

Here are 7 things you need to know.


𝟭. 𝗖𝗮𝗻 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗹𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗖𝗥𝗨𝗗 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗥𝗘𝗦𝗧?

CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations map to HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).


𝟮. 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗼𝗻 𝗛𝗧𝗧𝗣 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝘂𝘀 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲𝘀, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗱𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗺𝗲𝗮𝗻?

- 200 OK: Successful GET request.
- 201 Created: Successful POST request and resource created.
- 204 No Content: Successful DELETE request, no response body.
- 400 Bad Request: Invalid request data or parameters.
- 401 Unauthorized: Authentication is required, or credentials are invalid.
- 403 Forbidden: The authenticated user lacks access to the requested resource.
- 404 Not Found: The requested resource does not exist.
- 500 Internal Server Error: The server encountered an error.


𝟯. 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗗𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗜𝘁 𝗠𝗲𝗮𝗻 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗮 𝗥𝗘𝗦𝗧 𝗔𝗣𝗜 𝘁𝗼 𝗕𝗲 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀?

Statelessness ensures that each API request contains all the information needed for processing a request.


𝟰. 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗗𝗼 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗮 𝗥𝗘𝗦𝗧 𝗔𝗣𝗜?

Security is a significant concern in API design.

Be prepared to discuss authentication and authorization methods like API keys, OAuth, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens).


𝟱. 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗗𝗼 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗩𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮 𝗥𝗘𝗦𝗧 𝗔𝗣𝗜?

Versioning strategies:
- URL versioning
- Custom headers

Versionen keeps backward compatibility and smooth transitions as the API evolves.


𝟲. 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝗣𝗮𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗜𝘀 𝗜𝘁 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗶𝗻 𝗥𝗘𝗦𝗧 𝗔𝗣𝗜𝘀?

Pagination helps in handling large data sets by splitting them into smaller chunks.

Knowing how to implement pagination indicates that you can build scalable APIs.


𝟳. 𝗖𝗮𝗻 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗰𝘂𝘀𝘀 𝗥𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗟𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗜𝘁𝘀 𝗜𝗺𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲?

Rate limiting controls the number of API calls from a user in a given time frame, which is required for resource allocation and preventing abuse.
